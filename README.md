A modified version of the Carbonite addon, patched to work on Project Ascension (3.3.5a) private server. Currently still very buggy.

## Overview
Carbonite is a multi-feature addon that provides a Google Maps-style world map, quest tracking, and many other utilities. This version has been patched to handle nil index errors and crashes commonly encountered on Ascension.

## Features
- **Map System:** Zoomable, scrollable world map.
- **Quest Tracking:** detailed quest watch and database.
- **Ascension Compatibility:** Patched to prevent crashes related to missing map data or UI elements.
- **FarmHud Compatibility:** GatherMate2 and Routes pins work properly when FarmHud is active.

## Installation
1. Download the addon.
2. Extract to your `Interface/AddOns` folder.
3. Ensure the folder is named `Carbonite`.
